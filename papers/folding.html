    <p>
        Getting here,
        I presume you have printed the zine version of a paper on letter-size paper
        (Canada and USA)
        or A4-size paper (everywhere else).
        I presume you were able to print both sides of a single sheet,
        or that you can glue together both pages so that the blank sides kiss.
        The front-to-back rotation should be on the short size of the sheet of paper.
        The zine is folded in divided in 8 sections.
    <ol>
        <li>
            Lay the paper on a hard surface so that you can see the title section of the zine.
            That title section should be on the right of the sheet.
        <li>
            Fold the paper in half vertically,
            so that the title section goes to kiss the leftmost section of the zine.
            Now you no longer see the title section.
            (It's ok, don't worry, it's not gone, just hidden.)
        <li>
            Flip the folded paper so that the fold is on your right,
            and the kiss of the paper on the left.
        <li>
            Hold the top sheet on the left and bring it to the fold on your right,
            folding in the middle.
            Peekaboo! now you see the title section again.
        <li>
            Flip the booklet so the title section now smooches the table.
        <li>
            Hold the top sheet on the right and bring it to the fold on your left,
            folding in the middle.
    </ol>
    <p>
        You now have a M-shaped zine (or W-shaped if you live in the southern hemisphere).
        You can read it as if <em>turning the pages</em>.
        Having read the fourth section,
        keep opening and closing the folds as if they were book pages.
        Surprising how many words it takes to describe this otherwise very simple book-like motion.
        One day I'll draw all this and do away with these clumsy verbal instructions.
